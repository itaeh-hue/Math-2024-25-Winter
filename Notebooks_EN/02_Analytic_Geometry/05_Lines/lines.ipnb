## Lines

A line can be defined as a collection of points that satisfy a linear equation.

The equation of a line in a two-dimensional space can be expressed in various forms:

#### 1. Slope-Intercept Form

The slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is given by:
$$
y = mx + b
$$
where:

- $m$ is the slope of the line.
- $b$ is the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis).

#### 2. Point-Slope Form

When a line passes through a specific point $(x_0, y_0)$ and has slope $m$, its equation can be expressed as:
$$
y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)
$$

#### 3. Standard Form

The standard form of a line is given by:
$$
Ax + By + C = 0
$$
where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants, and $A, B \neq 0$.

## Slope of a Line

The slope $m$ of a line is a measure of its steepness and can be defined as the ratio of the change in $y$ (rise) to the change in $x$ (run) between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$: $$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

- A positive slope indicates that the line rises as it moves from left to right, while a negative slope indicates that it falls.

## Intercepts

#### Y-Intercept
The y-intercept of a line is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$. This point is represented as $(0, b)$.

#### X-Intercept
The x-intercept of a line is the value of $x$ when $y = 0$. To find the x-intercept, set $y = 0$ in the line equation and solve for $x$.

## Relationship Between Lines

#### Parallel Lines

Parallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. If two lines have equations in slope-intercept form $y = m_1x + b_1$ and $y = m_2x + b_2$, then they are parallel if:
$$
m_1 = m_2
$$

#### Perpendicular Lines

Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is $-1$. If $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the slopes of two lines, they are perpendicular if:
$$
m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1
$$

## Distance Between Two Points

The distance $d$ between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in the Cartesian plane can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:
$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$
